# SDLProject
C++, SDL, OpenGL project.  Basically copied Trilandia &amp; rewrote it in C++ without adding many of the items or blocks that were in Trilandia (or procedural terrain generation).  For this project I included framerate interpolation (for very smooth results), VSYNC toggling, VBO's, laser gun, and SAT collision detection that works pretty well for rotation objects.
